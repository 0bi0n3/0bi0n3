- 👋 Hi, I’m @0bi0n3, an audio designer and engineer, studying a part-time postgrad at University of West London.
- 👀 I’m interested in sound design, audio programming, game audio, time-stretching devices, ambiences, field recording and anything in between.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning DSP, C++, game engine/game audio specific sound design and Math (both applied to audio and uping my skills).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any game audio or sound design projects.
- 📫 How to reach me 👉 one-audio.co.uk
